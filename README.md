Covid 19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million confirmed cases and four million deaths across nearly 200 countries. By this hackathon we aim to provide some solutions for the global pandemic.

First we analysed the covid cases throughout the world to find the populations that have the highest risk of contracting Covid-19 using the mortality rate and growth rate of new cases.

Next we made a model to predict the occurrence of COVID-19 given the symptoms and activities of the people. It takes as input if the person is having symptoms like breathing problem, fever, dry cough, sore throat, running nose, headache, fatigue or has diseases like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, hyper tension, gastrointestinal. It also takes into account recent abroad travel, contact with COVID patient, attended Large Gathering, visited public exposed places, family working in public exposed places, wearing masks and sanitization from market. Given these inputs it predicts if the person has COVID-19 or not. We used various models and got best results using decision trees.

We have made a research paper recommender system that recommends research papers according to the query of the user.

Next, we have built a model to predict the level of sadness 

To find the severity of illness in a particular demographic, we find seven clusters of communities depending on the number of cases. Clustering is done through PCA and K means algorithm.

Lastly, we find countries in different continents that were successful in combating COVID using factors like new cases per population and fatality rate. We also look at the policies regarding Covid 19 with the hope that similar countries can implement these policies in their battle against Covid.
