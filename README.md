Covid 19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million confirmed cases and four million deaths across nearly 200 countries. By this hackathon we aim to provide some solutions for the global pandemic.

First we analysed the covid cases throughout the world to find the “POPULATIONS THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST RISK OF CONTRACTING COVID-19”. This is done in the case analysis folder.

Next we made a model to predict the occurrence of COVID-19 given the symptoms and activities of the people. It takes as input if the the person is having symptoms like breathing problem, fever, dry cough, sore throat, running nose, headache, fatigue or has diseases like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, hyper tension, gastrointestinal. It also takes into account recent abroad travel, contact with COVID patient, attended Large Gathering, visited public exposed places, family working in public exposed places, wearing masks and sanitization from market.  Given these inputs it predicts if the person has COVID-19 or not.  This is implemented in symptoms_covid_19 folder.

In countries clustering we find seven clusters of communities depending on the number of cases

Lastly, we find countries in different continents that were successful in combating COVID in Top Countries folder and look at the policies they had introduces at the start of the pandemic in Government Policies folder.
