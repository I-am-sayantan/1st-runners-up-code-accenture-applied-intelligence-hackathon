# About our project Support-Join-Aid-the-Battle-against-Covid19 :mask:

#### Covid 19 is continuing to spread around the world, with more than 180 million confirmed cases and four million deaths across nearly 200 countries. By this hackathon, we aim to provide some solutions for the global pandemic.

- First, we analyzed the covid cases throughout the world to find the populations that have the highest risk of contracting Covid-19 using the mortality rate and growth rate of new cases. This is done in case analysis folder.

- Next, we made a model predict the occurrence of COVID-19 given the symptoms and activities of the people. It takes as input if the person is having symptoms like breathing problems, fever, dry cough, sore throat, running nose, headache, fatigue, or has diseases like asthma, heart disease, diabetes, hyper tension, gastrointestinal. 

- It also takes into account recent abroad travel, contacts with COVID patients, attended Large Gathering, visited public exposed places, family working in public exposed places, wearing masks, and sanitization from the market. Given these inputs, it predicts if the person has COVID-19 or not. We used various models and got the best results using decision trees. This is done in symtoms-covid-19 folder.

- We have made a research paper recommender system that recommends research papers according to the query of the user. This is done in Research Paper Recommender system for covid folder.

- Next, we have built a model to predict the level of sadness using sentiment analysis.This is done in Sentiment Analysis folder.

- To find the severity of illness in a particular demographic, we find seven clusters of communities depending on the number of cases. Clustering is done through PCA and K means algorithm. This is done in countries clustering covid folder.

- Lastly, we find countries in different continents that were successful in combating COVID using factors like new cases per population and fatality rate. This is done in Top countries folder. We also look at the policies regarding Covid 19 with the hope that similar countries can implement these policies in their battle against Covid. This is done in government policies folder.

- We have also made our application here the tutorial to use it:
